Just recording my conversations with AI.

I’ve found a lot of interesting things while using AI to practice English.

On the one hand, I can speak bravely and confidently with AI, even though I might make mistakes.

On the other hand, I don’t want this practice to just come and go. I want to record something—to show me where my English can improve.

Maybe it’s my tenses, maybe it’s the small details—whatever it is, I just want to capture my thoughts and emotions. That’s all.

### ***My Question x***

***My Answer***

***The Native Version***

***My Mistake***

## 2025-12-01

### ***My Question 1(2025-12-01)***

***My Answer***

>ok let's go today english practice. i still don't receive the notification about interview. it make me very tired.i felt nervous and lack of energy last Friday.so just ignore it. stating my english learning.

***The Native Version***

>"I still ***haven't heard back*** about the interview, and it's really ***draining***. But I'm going to ***put it aside*** and start my English practice now."

***My Mistake***

1.从过去到现在一直没收到 -> 现在完成时 (Have/Has + done)
2.累
  1.如果只是普通累，直接用 tired。
  2.想强调程度强，用 exhausted / drained / burnt out。
  3.想表达心理或情绪累，可以用 stressed out / fed up。
3.放在一边

### ***My Question 2(2025-12-01)***

>"What is the hardest part about learning English for you right now? Is it vocabulary, listening, or just being afraid to speak?"
>(你觉得现在学英语最难的部分是什么？是单词、听力，还是仅仅是害怕开口？)

***My Answer***

>situation is very server.because whatever vocabulary, listening, or speak, both are hard. i usually forget the vocabulary which just remembered last week. because of this, i can't understand the listening. i afraid of making mistakes when speaking, so i don't have confidence in speaking.

***The Native Version***

>"To be honest, it's a ***tough*** situation. Vocabulary, listening, and speaking are ***ALL*** hard for me. I keep forgetting words I learned last week, so I can't understand what I hear. And because I'm afraid of making mistakes, I lose confidence when I speak."

***My Mistake***

1."Both" vs. "All" (两难 vs. 三难)
2.艰难
  1.tough / hard / challenging → 日常用，强调困难或挑战。
  2.severe / arduous(长时间努力) / strenuous(强调体力) → 正式或书面用，更强调艰苦、费力或严重性。

### ***My Question 3(2025-12-01)***

>What is the name of the book? (书名是什么？)
>提示: 这是一个事实，用一般现在时 (is...)
>Why did you choose this book? (你为什么选这本书？)
>提示: 这是一个过去的动作，选书是在以前发生的，用一般过去时 (chose / wanted...)

***My Answer***

>as your recommend i have choose the little prince. i think my english level is similar to child, maybe fairy tale is suit to my situation, i can start my reading instead of felling hard to difficult vocabulary.

***The Native Version***

>"As you recommended, I have chosen The Little Prince. I think my English level is similar to a child's, so maybe a fairy tale suits me better. This way, I can start reading without struggling with difficult vocabulary."

### ***My Question 4(2025-12-01)***

>"Have you seen that picture? Do you think it looks like a hat or a snake?"
>(你看到那幅画了吗？你觉得它看起来像帽子还是蛇？)

***My Answer***

>oh absolutely. i think it looks like a hat. maybe i have been lost my childlike innocence. i just think about thing that appear in my life.lose imagination.

***The Native Version***

>"Absolutely. It looks like a hat to me. Maybe I have lost my childlike innocence and my imagination. Nowadays, I only focus on reality and the things happening in my daily life."

***My Mistake***

## 2025-11-28

### ***My Question 1(2025-11-28)***

>"Tell me about yourself." (介绍一下你自己。)
>或者
>"Walk me through your resume." (过一遍你的简历。)

***My Answer***

>thank for give me this opportunity to introduce myself.my name is Gregory. i have over 3 years of experience working with financial system for Japanese clients, where i was involved in the whole lifecycle for the system. through contributing to several large-scale system upgrades. i gained valuable experience in finance, such as data integration  and reporting processes. recently, i have transitioned into sap, especially cloud and ai .i joined CPI virtual project and study AWS and SAP AI by myself. with AWS SAA and SAP integration suite certifications, i believe that building and connecting cloud-native with ai system to essential for the future. finally, what i want to  emphasize is that learning agility is often more important than pass experience, i just need a.chance to prove my value and i'm eager to apply my financial knowledges and technical skills to contribute in your OneStream project.

***The Native Version***
>"First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Gregory.
>I have over 3 years of experience working with financial systems for Japanese clients, where >I was involved in the full system development lifecycle.
>By contributing to several large-scale system upgrades, I gained valuable experience in finance, specifically in data integration and reporting processes.
>Recently, I have focused on SAP, cloud technology, and AI.
>I joined a CPI virtual project and have been studying AWS and SAP AI on my own. I now hold the AWS SAA and SAP Integration Suite certifications.
>I believe that connecting cloud-native tools with AI systems is essential for the future.
>Finally, what I want to emphasize is that learning agility is often more important than past experience.
>I just need a chance to prove my value. I am eager to leverage my financial knowledge and technical skills to contribute to your OneStream project."

***My Mistake***

1.Thank you for giving me... (介词 for 后面动词要加 ing)
2.Financial knowledge (Knowledge 是不可数名词，永远不加 s！)
3.Past experience
4.is essential

### ***My Question 2(2025-11-28)***

>Give me an example of your learning ability.
>
>How do you learn new technologies

***My Answer***

***The Native Version***

>"I pride myself on my learning agility. (我为我的敏捷学习能力感到自豪。)
>Recently, my company started a transformation. instead of waiting, I took the initiative to learn SAP BTP and Cloud technologies on my own.
>(Keyword: Took the initiative - 主动出击)
>
>Even though I didn't have a real project, I studied the documentation, used AI tools to help understand concepts, and built demo projects.
>As a result, I passed the AWS and SAP certifications in a short time.
>So, I am confident that I can get up to speed with OneStream very quickly using the same method."
>Keyword: Get up to speed - 快速上
>
>
>"I have a very practical approach to learning. (我有一套非常务实的学习方法。)
>First, I read the official documentation to understand the core logic.
>Then, I immediately move to the hands-on phase. I build small demos to test what I learned.
>For example, when learning AI, I didn't just read theories. I tried to write code to call APIs and integrate them.
>I believe this 'Learning by Doing' style fits perfectly with the OneStream role. I won't just ask questions; I will try to find answers myself first."
>(Keyword: Learning by doing - 干中学)

***My Mistake***

1.Steep learning curve (陡峭的学习曲线 = 很难学)"I am not afraid of a steep learning curve." (我不怕东西难学。)
2.Self-driven (自驱的):"I am a self-driven learner." (不用别人逼我，我自己学。)
3."I aim to become productive as soon as possible."

### ***My Question 1(2025-11-27)***

>"What is your main goal for today?"
>(你今天的主要目标是什么？)

***My Answer***

>what matters to me is study.
>
>i do not have project right now, so i don't have clear goal for recent days.
>
>just watch the document which the learning recourse of SAP Certified - SAP Generative AI Developer.
>
>to be honest, it' a little boring right now.my english word is lack when i see the technical document which it makes me sad.
>
>can you give me some advices which build knowledge easily and keep study enthusiasm .

***The Native Version***

>"What matters to me right now is studying.
>
>Since I don't have a project, I don't have clear goals for these days.
>
>I'm just reading the documentation, which is the resource for the 'SAP Generative AI Developer' certification.
>
>To be honest, it's a little boring. My vocabulary is limited when dealing with technical documents, which makes me feel frustrated (比 sad 更精准，表示有挫败感).
>
>Could you give me some advice on how to build knowledge easily and maintain my enthusiasm?"

***My Mistake***

1. is studying
   1. > v+ing 作为名词
2. which is the resource
   1. Which 作为主语 后面接动词
3. vocabulary
   1. watch the document -> reading the documentation
   2. my english word is lack -> My vocabulary is limited
   3. see the technical document -> (I am)dealing with technical documents
   4. makes me sad -> feel frustrated

### ***My Question 1(2025-11-26)***

>"Which programming language (or tool) do you use the most in your work, and how does it help you?"
>
(你在工作中用得最多的编程语言或工具是什么？它怎么帮助你的？)

***My Answer***

>absolutely, using the most programming language is java.
>
>when i was an university student, we begun touch programming language is c and c++,but c and c++ is very difficult.
>
>you know c and c++ have a lots of configuration which need you config, and indicator concept is hardly understand.
>
>but java is different.i don't need to spend much time to set configuration.
>just use it, after that, you can get strong enterprise structure and application.
>

***The Native Version***

>The programming language I use the most is Java.
>
>When I was a university student, we started with C and C++, which are very difficult.
>
>C++ has a lot of configurations which require manual setup. Also, the concept of pointers is hard to understand.
>
>However, Java is different. You don't need to spend much time on configuration, which allows you to build strong enterprise applications quickly."
>

***My Mistake***

1.你的原句: absolutely, using the most programming language is java.
修改版: The programming language I use the most is Java.
>语法: "Using... is Java" 这种主语结构有点乱。
>地道: 这种强调句，标准语序是 "The [thing] I [verb] the most is [Answer]."（我最...的东西是...）。

2.你的原句: when i was an university student, we begun touch programming language is c and c++,
修改版: When I was a university student, we started with C and C++,
>词汇: "Touch" (触摸) 这里的用法太中式了。开始学某个东西，我们通常说 "start with"。
>动词: 原句里的 "is c and c++" 导致一个句子里有两个动词（begun, is），这是语法大忌。

3.你的原句: but c and c++ is very difficult.you know c and c++ have a lots of configuration which need you config,
修改版: ... which are very difficult. C++ has a lot of configurations which require manual setup.
>Which技巧: 我把你的 "but..." 变成了 ", which are very difficult"。这样就少了一个短句，多了一个复合句。
>词汇: "need you config" -> "require manual setup" (需要手动设置)。"Config" 是动词 configuration 的缩写，口语可以用，但 "manual setup" 听起来更专业。

4.你的原句: and indicator concept is hardly understand.
修改版: Also, the concept of pointers is hard to understand.
>专业术语: Indicator (指示器) ❌ -> Pointer (指针) ✅。
>致命语法: Hardly (几乎不) ❌ -> Hard to (很难去...) ✅。
>结构: "Understand" 是动词，不能直接放在 be动词 (is) 后面，变成 "is hard to understand" (不定式) 就对了。

5.你的原句: just use it, after that, you can get strong enterprise structure...
修改版: ... which allows you to build strong enterprise applications...
>高级感: 你用了 "after that" (时间顺序)，我用了 "which allows you to" (逻辑因果)。
>效果: 这种结构体现了 Java 的特性直接导致了后面的好结果，逻辑更紧密。

### ***My Question 2(2025-11-26)***

>"Why do you think cloud technology (like SAP BTP) is important for modern businesses?"

***My Answer***

>in my opinion, cloud have two side.
>
>on the one hand, cloud brings more convenient in development and build a career.
>
>if you have a good idea, you don't need  pay attention to maintain server.
>
>just pay money to cloud company like AWS and so on.
>
>on the other hand, cloud is not safe at all, lots of clients believe famous company's service.
>
>but  suddenly  something happened, you will lose your data, because the data is't in your hand.
>
>and other question is cloud company in order to sale their service, bring thing more complex, the cost is more than maintain by yourself.
>
>so it's very difficult to evaluate

***The Native Version***

>"In my opinion, cloud technology has two sides.
>
>On the one hand, the cloud brings convenience to development. If you have a good idea, you don't need to worry about maintaining servers.
>
>You just pay providers like AWS so that they handle the infrastructure.
>On the other hand, the cloud is not completely safe.
>
>Many clients trust famous companies, but if something unexpected happens, you will lose your data because it isn't in your hands.
>
>Another issue is that cloud companies often make things complex in order to sell more services, which makes the cost higher than maintaining it yourself.
>
>So, it's very difficult to evaluate."

***My Mistake***

1.你的原句: "cloud company in order to sale their service"
纠错:
>Sale (名词): 打折、销售额 (For sale, On sale).
>Sell (动词): 卖.
>修正: "...in order to sell their services."

2.你的原句: "cloud brings more convenient in development and build a career."
>解析: 这里你可能想说“搭建业务”或者“构建环境”。"Career" 指的是你个人的职业生涯。
>地道表达: "...makes development and building infrastructure more convenient."

3."just pay money to cloud company like AWS... you don't need pay attention to maintain server."
>如果我们用上 "so that" (复合句技巧)，这句话就会变成：
>"You just pay cloud providers like AWS so that you don't need to worry about server maintenance."

### ***My Question 3(2025-11-26)***

>"Do you think it is better to be a 'Full-stack Developer' (knows everything) or a 'Specialist' (expert in one specific area like SAP)? Why?"

***My Answer***

>To be honest, i don't know what advantage of Full-stack Developer or Specialist in SAP.
>
>I wanna become a SAP BTP Developer, just if you want to design iFlows , you should know api design and java base.in my per project, i was responsible for java backend development.
>
>so i was experience in this area. and my company nav transformation, we don't have any java project, so my choose is very small.
>
>but i need a job , for get a project so that i choose SAP BTP Developer. because marketplace need SAP BTP Developer.
>
>while transformation is hard to me, because your experience become nothing , in order to my experience don't become nothing, i chose SAP BTP Developer, i have java base ,i can learn it as soon as possible even though i don't have project right now.
>
>i will try my best to avoid loss my job.including studying english right now.

***The Native Version***

>"To be honest, I'm not sure about the general advantages of being a Full-stack Developer versus a Specialist.
>
>My choice to become an SAP BTP Developer is practical. If you want to design iFlows, you need to know API design and have a Java background.
>
>In my previous project, I was responsible for Java backend development, so I am experienced in this area.
>
>Currently, my company is going through a transformation, and we don't have many Java projects left, so my choices are limited.
>
>While this transition is hard for me, I chose SAP BTP so that my experience doesn't go to waste. Since I already have a Java foundation, I can learn it quickly even though I don't have a live project right now.
>
>I am doing my best to stay competitive, including studying English."

***My Mistake***

1.你说的: "in order to my experience don't become nothing"
  >解析: "Become nothing" 听起来有点太口语化。且 in order to 后面必须加动词原形，不能加句子。
  >地道表达: 我们通常说“不浪费我的经验”。
  >"So that my experience doesn't go to waste." (最地道 ⭐)
  >"In order to leverage my experience." (为了利用我的经验)

2.你说的: "in my per project"
>解析: "Per" 是“每一个”。你想说的应该是“之前的”。
>纠正: "In my previous project..."

3."Base" vs "Background"
>你说的: "java base"
>纠正: 我们通常说 "Java background" (Java背景) 或者 "Knowledge of Java"。
