Just recording my conversations with AI.

I’ve found a lot of interesting things while using AI to practice English.

On the one hand, I can speak bravely and confidently with AI, even though I might make mistakes.

On the other hand, I don’t want this practice to just come and go. I want to record something—to show me where my English can improve.

Maybe it’s my tenses, maybe it’s the small details—whatever it is, I just want to capture my thoughts and emotions. That’s all.

Recently, i have forced on English, So i try to leverage english to share my Blog. the second question, i don't have any fans, my Blog is created on the Github, just like my notebook On the internet. i can edit it everywhere which convenient for me.

***The Native Version***

>"I write my blog in three languages: Chinese, English, and Japanese.
>Since Chinese is my native language, that's no surprise. However, I also have over 5 years of experience working on Japanese projects, so my past posts were mostly written in Japanese.
>Recently, I have focused on English, so I am trying to use it more for my blog.
>I don't really have an audience yet. My blog is hosted on GitHub, acting just like my personal online notebook. I can edit it from anywhere, which is very convenient."

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **i use 3 type of languages to write my blog** | I write my blog in **three languages**: | "3 types of" 有点啰嗦，直接说 "in three languages". |
| **My native speak is Chinese** | My **native language** (or **mother tongue**) is Chinese, | **Speak** 是动词；**Language** 才是名词。 |
| **so it's not surprise.** | so **it's no surprise**. | 固定搭配: It's **no** surprise. |
| **i have over 5 years of experiences** | I have over 5 years of **experience**. | **Experience** 表示“经验”时是不可数名词 (Uncountable)，不加 s。 |
| **my past Blog almost used Japanese to recorded.** | ...and my past blog posts were **mostly written in Japanese**. | "Used Japanese to recorded" 语法混乱，用被动语态 "were written" 更顺。 |
| **Recently, i have forced on English,** | Recently, I have **focused on** English. | ❌ **Forced** (强迫) -> ✅ **Focused** (专注). |
| **So i try to leverage english to share my Blog.** | ...so I'm trying to **use English** for my blog. | "Leverage" (杠杆/利用) 有点太商业了，**Use** 更自然。 |
| **i don't have any fans,** | I don't have **an audience** / **any followers** yet, | "Fans" 听起来像娱乐明星，博主通常说 Audience/Followers。 |
| **my Blog is created on the Github,** | but my blog is **hosted on GitHub**. | 放在网上通常用 **Hosted**；GitHub前通常不加 "the"。 |
| **i can edit it everywhere which convenient for me.** | I can edit it **from anywhere**, **which is** convenient for me. | Everywhere 是地点，From anywhere 是来源；缺少了连接词 **which is**。 |

### ***My Question 2(2025-12-03)***

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **but i have some .. i don't know how to say it** | but I have some... **thoughts**, or I'm not sure how to put it. | 当你卡壳时，可以用 "thoughts" 或者 "doubts" 来填补。 |
| **maybe the frontend should be more cooler.** | Maybe the frontend should be **cooler**. | ❌ **More cooler** (更更酷) -> ✅ **Cooler**. (不要叠用比较级！) |
| **right now it's looks a little boring.** | Right now **it looks** a little boring. | ❌ **It's (It is) looks** -> ✅ **It looks**. (系动词不能和实义动词打架)。 |
| **i can easily write posts by markdown,** | I can easily write posts **in** Markdown, | 用某种语言/格式，通常用介词 **in**。 |
| **i can build smoothly by Github action.** | and it **builds** smoothly **with** GitHub Actions. | 工具通常用 **with**；GitHub Actions 通常用复数。 |

### ***My Question 1(2025-12-02)***

***My Answer***

>hello hello.wake up.it's time to today's english practice. i have finished the interview last day.it' over.the interviewer evaluate me you have development experience that ok, but your account is cnglish. if you want to join the project, you should prove your english, make more practice. oh to be honest, it a bad single for me does't it? all is pass, just practice english! when you feedback, i will try to answer the question if you have your own small planet.

***The Native Version***

>"Hello, hello! Wake up! ***It's time for today's*** English practice.
>I ***finished*** the interview the other day. It's ***finally*** over. The interviewer said my development experience is good, but my accent is a bit 'Chinglish.'
>He told me that if I want to join the project, I need to prove my English skills and practice more.
>To be honest, that's a bad ***sign, isn't it?*** But ***what's done is done*** (过去的事就过去了). I just need to practice!
>After your feedback, I'll try to answer the question about the small planet."

***My Mistake***

1. It's time for... 是固定搭配。
2. 有具体时间(last day/yesterday)必须用一般过去时，不能用 Have finished
3. 加个 finally (终于) 能体现出如释重负的感觉。
4. Evaluate 是动词，这里用 said 引述更自然。
5. Accent (口音)  Practice (Practice本身就是动词)。Sign (信号) Feedback 通常作名词用.

### ***My Question 2(2025-12-02)***

>"If you had your own small planet, what would be on it?"

***My Answer***
>first of all, i will build a security protect on my planet. maybe the protect have some "mistakes". you know, a little bit surprises is good for my life.maybe meet someone and so on. second, i need music, music can make me calm down, let me fell happiness. third, maybe build some gym, i like exercise, when i do exercise, i can don't think everything, i can keep piece.

***The Native Version***
>"If I had my own planet, first, I would build a security system.
>But maybe the system would have some glitches on purpose. You know, a few surprises are good for life—I might meet someone!
>Second, I need music. Music makes me calm down and helps me feel happy.
>Third, I would build a gym. I like exercise. When I work out, I can stop thinking about everything and find my inner peace."

***Comparison Time***

| 你的原话 (Original) | 地道修正版 (Native Version) | 💡 关键修改点 (Key Notes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **if i have a own planet.** | If I **had my own** planet... | 虚拟语气通常用 had；"A own" ❌ -> "**My own**" ✅. |
| **i will build a security protect on my planet.** | I would build a **security system** (or **shield**) on it. | **Protect** 是动作(动词)；**Protection** 或 **System** 才是东西(名词)。 |
| **maybe the protect have some "mistakes".** | Maybe the **system** would have some "**glitches**" or "**loopholes**". | 机器出的错通常叫 **Glitches**；规则漏洞叫 **Loopholes**。 |
| **you know, a little bit surprises is good for my life.** | You know, a few **surprises are** good for my life. | Surprises 是复数 -> 用 **are**。 |
| **let me fell happiness.** | ...and let me **feel** happy. | ❌ **Fell** (掉下/砍伐) -> ✅ **Feel** (感觉)。 |
| **i can don't think everything,** | ...so I **can stop thinking about** everything, | ❌ **Can don't** (语法错误) -> ✅ **Can stop thinking**. |
| **i can keep piece.** | ...and I can **find peace**. | ❌ **Piece** (一片) -> ✅ **Peace** (和平/宁静)。 |

### ***My Question 1(2025-12-01)***

***My Answer***

>ok let's go today english practice. i still don't receive the notification about interview. it make me very tired.i felt nervous and lack of energy last Friday.so just ignore it. stating my english learning.

***The Native Version***

>"I still ***haven't heard back*** about the interview, and it's really ***draining***. But I'm going to ***put it aside*** and start my English practice now."

***My Mistake***

1.从过去到现在一直没收到 -> 现在完成时 (Have/Has + done)
2.累
  1.如果只是普通累，直接用 tired。
  2.想强调程度强，用 exhausted / drained / burnt out。
  3.想表达心理或情绪累，可以用 stressed out / fed up。
3.放在一边

### ***My Question 2(2025-12-01)***

>"What is the hardest part about learning English for you right now? Is it vocabulary, listening, or just being afraid to speak?"
>(你觉得现在学英语最难的部分是什么？是单词、听力，还是仅仅是害怕开口？)

***My Answer***

>situation is very server.because whatever vocabulary, listening, or speak, both are hard. i usually forget the vocabulary which just remembered last week. because of this, i can't understand the listening. i afraid of making mistakes when speaking, so i don't have confidence in speaking.

***The Native Version***

>"To be honest, it's a ***tough*** situation. Vocabulary, listening, and speaking are ***ALL*** hard for me. I keep forgetting words I learned last week, so I can't understand what I hear. And because I'm afraid of making mistakes, I lose confidence when I speak."

***My Mistake***

1."Both" vs. "All" (两难 vs. 三难)
2.艰难
  1.tough / hard / challenging → 日常用，强调困难或挑战。
  2.severe / arduous(长时间努力) / strenuous(强调体力) → 正式或书面用，更强调艰苦、费力或严重性。

### ***My Question 3(2025-12-01)***

>What is the name of the book? (书名是什么？)
>提示: 这是一个事实，用一般现在时 (is...)
>Why did you choose this book? (你为什么选这本书？)
>提示: 这是一个过去的动作，选书是在以前发生的，用一般过去时 (chose / wanted...)

***My Answer***

>as your recommend i have choose the little prince. i think my english level is similar to child, maybe fairy tale is suit to my situation, i can start my reading instead of felling hard to difficult vocabulary.

***The Native Version***

>"As you recommended, I have chosen The Little Prince. I think my English level is similar to a child's, so maybe a fairy tale suits me better. This way, I can start reading without struggling with difficult vocabulary."

### ***My Question 4(2025-12-01)***

>"Have you seen that picture? Do you think it looks like a hat or a snake?"
>(你看到那幅画了吗？你觉得它看起来像帽子还是蛇？)

***My Answer***

>oh absolutely. i think it looks like a hat. maybe i have been lost my childlike innocence. i just think about thing that appear in my life.lose imagination.

***The Native Version***

>"Absolutely. It looks like a hat to me. Maybe I have lost my childlike innocence and my imagination. Nowadays, I only focus on reality and the things happening in my daily life."

***My Mistake***

## 2025-11-28

### ***My Question 1(2025-11-28)***

>"Tell me about yourself." (介绍一下你自己。)
>或者
>"Walk me through your resume." (过一遍你的简历。)

***My Answer***

>thank for give me this opportunity to introduce myself.my name is Gregory. i have over 3 years of experience working with financial system for Japanese clients, where i was involved in the whole lifecycle for the system. through contributing to several large-scale system upgrades. i gained valuable experience in finance, such as data integration  and reporting processes. recently, i have transitioned into sap, especially cloud and ai .i joined CPI virtual project and study AWS and SAP AI by myself. with AWS SAA and SAP integration suite certifications, i believe that building and connecting cloud-native with ai system to essential for the future. finally, what i want to  emphasize is that learning agility is often more important than pass experience, i just need a.chance to prove my value and i'm eager to apply my financial knowledges and technical skills to contribute in your OneStream project.

***The Native Version***
>"First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Gregory.

>Finally, what I want to emphasize is that learning agility is often more important than past experience.
>I just need a chance to prove my value. I am eager to leverage my financial knowledge and technical skills to contribute to your OneStream project."

***My Mistake***

1.Thank you for giving me... (介词 for 后面动词要加 ing)
2.Financial knowledge (Knowledge 是不可数名词，永远不加 s！)
3.Past experience
4.is essential

### ***My Question 2(2025-11-28)***

>Give me an example of your learning ability.
>
>How do you learn new technologies

***My Answer***

***The Native Version***

>"I pride myself on my learning agility. (我为我的敏捷学习能力感到自豪。)
>Recently, my company started a transformation. instead of waiting, I took the initiative to learn SAP BTP and Cloud technologies on my own.
>(Keyword: Took the initiative - 主动出击)
>
>Even though I didn't have a real project, I studied the documentation, used AI tools to help understand concepts, and built demo projects.
>As a result, I passed the AWS and SAP certifications in a short time.
>So, I am confident that I can get up to speed with OneStream very quickly using the same method."
>Keyword: Get up to speed - 快速上
>
>
>"I have a very practical approach to learning. (我有一套非常务实的学习方法。)
>First, I read the official documentation to understand the core logic.
>Then, I immediately move to the hands-on phase. I build small demos to test what I learned.
>For example, when learning AI, I didn't just read theories. I tried to write code to call APIs and integrate them.
>I believe this 'Learning by Doing' style fits perfectly with the OneStream role. I won't just ask questions; I will try to find answers myself first."
>(Keyword: Learning by doing - 干中学)

***My Mistake***

1.Steep learning curve (陡峭的学习曲线 = 很难学)"I am not afraid of a steep learning curve." (我不怕东西难学。)
2.Self-driven (自驱的):"I am a self-driven learner." (不用别人逼我，我自己学。)
3."I aim to become productive as soon as possible."

## 2025-11-27

### ***My Question 1(2025-11-27)***

>"What is your main goal for today?"
>(你今天的主要目标是什么？)

***My Answer***

>what matters to me is study.
>
>i do not have project right now, so i don't have clear goal for recent days.

>
>to be honest, it' a little boring right now.my english word is lack when i see the technical document which it makes me sad.
>
>can you give me some advices which build knowledge easily and keep study enthusiasm .

***The Native Version***

>"What matters to me right now is studying.
>
>Since I don't have a project, I don't have clear goals for these days.
>
>I'm just reading the documentation, which is the resource for the 'SAP Generative AI Developer' certification.
>
>To be honest, it's a little boring. My vocabulary is limited when dealing with technical documents, which makes me feel frustrated (比 sad 更精准，表示有挫败感).
>
>Could you give me some advice on how to build knowledge easily and maintain my enthusiasm?"

***My Mistake***

1. is studying
   1. > v+ing 作为名词
2. which is the resource
   1. Which 作为主语 后面接动词
3. vocabulary
   1. watch the document -> reading the documentation
   2. my english word is lack -> My vocabulary is limited
   3. see the technical document -> (I am)dealing with technical documents
   4. makes me sad -> feel frustrated

## 2025-11-26

### ***My Question 1(2025-11-26)***

>"Which programming language (or tool) do you use the most in your work, and how does it help you?"
>
(你在工作中用得最多的编程语言或工具是什么？它怎么帮助你的？)

***My Answer***

>absolutely, using the most programming language is java.
>
>when i was an university student, we begun touch programming language is c and c++,but c and c++ is very difficult.
>
>you know c and c++ have a lots of configuration which need you config, and indicator concept is hardly understand.
>
>but java is different.i don't need to spend much time to set configuration.
>just use it, after that, you can get strong enterprise structure and application.
>

***The Native Version***

>The programming language I use the most is Java.
>
>When I was a university student, we started with C and C++, which are very difficult.
>
>C++ has a lot of configurations which require manual setup. Also, the concept of pointers is hard to understand.
>
>However, Java is different. You don't need to spend much time on configuration, which allows you to build strong enterprise applications quickly."
>

***My Mistake***

1.你的原句: absolutely, using the most programming language is java.
修改版: The programming language I use the most is Java.
>语法: "Using... is Java" 这种主语结构有点乱。
>地道: 这种强调句，标准语序是 "The [thing] I [verb] the most is [Answer]."（我最...的东西是...）。

2.你的原句: when i was an university student, we begun touch programming language is c and c++,
修改版: When I was a university student, we started with C and C++,
>词汇: "Touch" (触摸) 这里的用法太中式了。开始学某个东西，我们通常说 "start with"。
>动词: 原句里的 "is c and c++" 导致一个句子里有两个动词（begun, is），这是语法大忌。

3.你的原句: but c and c++ is very difficult.you know c and c++ have a lots of configuration which need you config,
修改版: ... which are very difficult. C++ has a lot of configurations which require manual setup.
>Which技巧: 我把你的 "but..." 变成了 ", which are very difficult"。这样就少了一个短句，多了一个复合句。
>词汇: "need you config" -> "require manual setup" (需要手动设置)。"Config" 是动词 configuration 的缩写，口语可以用，但 "manual setup" 听起来更专业。

4.你的原句: and indicator concept is hardly understand.
修改版: Also, the concept of pointers is hard to understand.
>专业术语: Indicator (指示器) ❌ -> Pointer (指针) ✅。
>致命语法: Hardly (几乎不) ❌ -> Hard to (很难去...) ✅。
>结构: "Understand" 是动词，不能直接放在 be动词 (is) 后面，变成 "is hard to understand" (不定式) 就对了。

5.你的原句: just use it, after that, you can get strong enterprise structure...
修改版: ... which allows you to build strong enterprise applications...
>高级感: 你用了 "after that" (时间顺序)，我用了 "which allows you to" (逻辑因果)。
>效果: 这种结构体现了 Java 的特性直接导致了后面的好结果，逻辑更紧密。

### ***My Question 2(2025-11-26)***

>"Why do you think cloud technology (like SAP BTP) is important for modern businesses?"

***My Answer***

>in my opinion, cloud have two side.
>
>on the one hand, cloud brings more convenient in development and build a career.
>
>if you have a good idea, you don't need  pay attention to maintain server.
>
>just pay money to cloud company like AWS and so on.
>
>on the other hand, cloud is not safe at all, lots of clients believe famous company's service.
>
>but  suddenly  something happened, you will lose your data, because the data is't in your hand.
>
>and other question is cloud company in order to sale their service, bring thing more complex, the cost is more than maintain by yourself.
>
>so it's very difficult to evaluate

***The Native Version***

>"In my opinion, cloud technology has two sides.
>
>On the one hand, the cloud brings convenience to development. If you have a good idea, you don't need to worry about maintaining servers.
>
>You just pay providers like AWS so that they handle the infrastructure.
>On the other hand, the cloud is not completely safe.
>
>Many clients trust famous companies, but if something unexpected happens, you will lose your data because it isn't in your hands.
>
>Another issue is that cloud companies often make things complex in order to sell more services, which makes the cost higher than maintaining it yourself.
>
>So, it's very difficult to evaluate."

***My Mistake***

1.你的原句: "cloud company in order to sale their service"
纠错:
>Sale (名词): 打折、销售额 (For sale, On sale).
>Sell (动词): 卖.
>修正: "...in order to sell their services."

2.你的原句: "cloud brings more convenient in development and build a career."
>解析: 这里你可能想说“搭建业务”或者“构建环境”。"Career" 指的是你个人的职业生涯。
>地道表达: "...makes development and building infrastructure more convenient."

3."just pay money to cloud company like AWS... you don't need pay attention to maintain server."
>如果我们用上 "so that" (复合句技巧)，这句话就会变成：
>"You just pay cloud providers like AWS so that you don't need to worry about server maintenance."

### ***My Question 3(2025-11-26)***

>"Do you think it is better to be a 'Full-stack Developer' (knows everything) or a 'Specialist' (expert in one specific area like SAP)? Why?"

***My Answer***

>To be honest, i don't know what advantage of Full-stack Developer or Specialist in SAP.
>
>I wanna become a SAP BTP Developer, just if you want to design iFlows , you should know api design and java base.in my per project, i was responsible for java backend development.
>
>so i was experience in this area. and my company nav transformation, we don't have any java project, so my choose is very small.
>
>but i need a job , for get a project so that i choose SAP BTP Developer. because marketplace need SAP BTP Developer.
>
>while transformation is hard to me, because your experience become nothing , in order to my experience don't become nothing, i chose SAP BTP Developer, i have java base ,i can learn it as soon as possible even though i don't have project right now.
>
>i will try my best to avoid loss my job.including studying english right now.

***The Native Version***

>"To be honest, I'm not sure about the general advantages of being a Full-stack Developer versus a Specialist.
>
>My choice to become an SAP BTP Developer is practical. If you want to design iFlows, you need to know API design and have a Java background.
>
>In my previous project, I was responsible for Java backend development, so I am experienced in this area.
>
>Currently, my company is going through a transformation, and we don't have many Java projects left, so my choices are limited.
>
>While this transition is hard for me, I chose SAP BTP so that my experience doesn't go to waste. Since I already have a Java foundation, I can learn it quickly even though I don't have a live project right now.
>
>I am doing my best to stay competitive, including studying English."

***My Mistake***

1.你说的: "in order to my experience don't become nothing"
  >解析: "Become nothing" 听起来有点太口语化。且 in order to 后面必须加动词原形，不能加句子。
  >地道表达: 我们通常说“不浪费我的经验”。
  >"So that my experience doesn't go to waste." (最地道 ⭐)
  >"In order to leverage my experience." (为了利用我的经验)

2.你说的: "in my per project"
>解析: "Per" 是“每一个”。你想说的应该是“之前的”。
>纠正: "In my previous project..."

3."Base" vs "Background"
>你说的: "java base"
>纠正: 我们通常说 "Java background" (Java背景) 或者 "Knowledge of Java"。
